Hi, dear user!
-------------- 
<p>Everyone in life has a moment when it is necessary to find a line in the file with the maximum sum of numbers in it. Is that familiar? Well, you're in luck, because now this problem has a solution! Just specify the path to the file in the console, and the program will display you a line number with the maximum sum of numbers. Lines format: <strong>"1,2,3,5.6,-7.8"</strong>.</p>
<p>PS A compliment from the chef: all invalid lines will be displayed as a bonus.</p>
