Hi! 
Everyone in life has a moment when it is necessary to find a line in the file with the maximum sum of numbers in it. Is that familiar? Well, you're in luck, because now this problem has a solution! Just specify the path to the file in the console, and the program will display you a line number with the maximum sum of numbers. Lines format: "1,2,3,5.6,-7.8".
PS A compliment from the chef: all invalid lines will be displayed as a bonus.
